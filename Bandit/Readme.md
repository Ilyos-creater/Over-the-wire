# Bandit Wargame Solutions

This repository contains my solutions and walkthroughs for the **Bandit** wargame, part of the OverTheWire Linux-based challenges. Bandit is an excellent starting point for learning basic Linux commands, file system navigation, and system-level concepts. Through these challenges, I aim to improve my Linux command-line skills while documenting key insights and strategies.

## Current Progress

I am currently solving the **Bandit** wargame, which focuses on:

- Basic Linux commands and navigation
- Understanding file permissions and ownership
- Using `ssh` to connect to remote systems
- File manipulation, including hidden files and special filenames
- Basic scripting techniques

As I progress, I document each level with a detailed solution and lessons learned.

## Examples

### **Level 0**
- **Objective**: Connect to the Bandit server using `ssh`.
- **Command**:
  ```bash
  ssh bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
Key Takeaway: Learned how to establish SSH connections to remote servers with specific ports.

Learnings and Goals:
Improved Command-Line Proficiency: Exploring Linux commands in real-world scenarios.
Better Problem-Solving: Understanding system-level challenges and crafting solutions.
Foundation for Advanced Challenges: Bandit lays the groundwork for tackling more complex OverTheWire wargames.
I plan to add solutions for other OverTheWire games as I progress.
