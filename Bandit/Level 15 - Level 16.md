### 1. Connect to the Bandit Server
Establish an SSH connection to the Bandit server using the provided credentials:

```sh
ssh bandit15@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
```

```

### 2. Submit the Password to Port 30001 using SSL/TLS
Once logged in, use `ncat` with the `--ssl` flag to securely send the current password to port `30001` on `localhost`:

```sh
echo "8xCjnmgoKbGLhHFAZlGE5Tmu4M2tKJQo" | ncat --ssl localhost 30001
```

### 3. Retrieve the Next Level's Password
After sending the password, the server responds with the password for the next level:

```

```

### 4. Use the New Password for the Next Level

```sh
ssh bandit16@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
```

Password:
