# OverTheWire Linux Game Solutions

This repository contains my solutions and walkthroughs for the [OverTheWire](https://overthewire.org/wargames/) Linux-based wargame challenges. These challenges are designed to improve Linux command-line skills and provide hands-on practice with system-level concepts.

---

## Current Progress: Bandit
I am currently working on the **Bandit** wargame. Bandit is the entry-level challenge in the OverTheWire series and focuses on:

- Basic Linux commands
- Navigating the file system
- Understanding file permissions
- Working with SSH and basic scripting

...

## Structure
The repository is organized by levels/games and includes the following:

1. **Level Description**: A brief explanation of the challenge.
2. **Solution Steps**: Commands and strategies used to solve the level.
3. **Learnings**: Key takeaways from the challenge.

### Folder Structure
. ├── Bandit/ │ ├── Level-0.md │ ├── Level-1.md │ ├── ... │ └── Level-n.md └── README.md

Each file contains:
- Challenge Description
- Commands Used
- Step-by-Step Walkthrough
- Lessons Learned


I am currently only playing the Bandit game, later on I will hopefully include more detailed explanations to other games.

### Credits
